# Install
```
$ composer require oveleon/contao-cookiebar
```

The cookie bar can also be installed via the Contao Manager. Just find the package and click on add. For more information, see [Contao Manager](https://docs.contao.org/manual/de/installation/erweiterungen-installieren/).

Once the package is installed, the Cookiebar menu item appears in the system palette in the main navigation of the backend. Here you can create and manage multiple [configurations](CONFIGURATION.md) of a cookie bar. Afterwards it can be assigned to a ROOT page.
