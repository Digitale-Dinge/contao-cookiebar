# Install
```
$ composer require oveleon/contao-cookiebar
```

The cookie bar can also be installed via the Contao Manager. Just find the package and click on add. For more information, see [Contao Manager](https://docs.contao.org/manual/en/installation/install-extensions/).

Once the package is installed, the cookie bar menu item appears in the system palette in the main navigation of the backend. Here you can create and manage multiple [configurations](CONFIGURATION.md) of a cookie bar. 

Once done, a configuration can be assigned to a ROOT page to activate the respective cookie bar.
