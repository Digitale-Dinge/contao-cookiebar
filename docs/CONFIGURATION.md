# Install
```
$ composer require oveleon/contao-cookiebar
```

The cookie bar can also be installed via the Contao Manager. Just find the package and click on add. For more information, see [Contao Manager](https://docs.contao.org/manual/de/installation/erweiterungen-installieren/).

# Configuration
Once the package is installed, the Cookiebar menu item appears in the system palette in the main navigation of the backend. Here you can create and manage multiple configurations of a cookie bar. Afterwards it can be assigned to a ROOT page.

### Basic configuration
Basic settings must be maintained via the `config/config.yml` file.

```yaml
contao_cookiebar:
  consider_dnt: true
  cookie:
    lifetime: 60*60*24*365
    token: ccb_contao_token
  elements:
    youtube: ce_youtube
    vimeo: ce_vimeo
```

Parameter | Description
---------- | -----------
`consider_dnt` | Consider "Do not Track" browser setting.
`cookie.lifetime` | The lifetime of the system cookie of the cookie bar settings
`cookie.token` | The technical name / Token
`elements.*` | An array containing the "`cookie-type`:`content element`" to be blocked

### Create new configuration

Field | Description

`Title` | The internal title
`Title & Description` | A title and description which is displayed in the header of the cookie bar

â„¹ After creating a configuration, cookie settings necessary for the system are automatically created. If you do not want to display essential cookies, you can simply hide them.
