## Create new cookie group
You can create additional cookie groups and thus create a meaningful separation between analysis cookies and others. A special feature is that groups can also be created without cookies and thus only act as a descriptive group.

Field | Description
---------- | -----------
`Group title` | A meaningful group title which describes the cookies in this group
`Description` | A description which provides further information about this group
